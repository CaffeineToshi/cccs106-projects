## ðŸ”¹ Git Configuration

### Repository Setup
- **GitHub Repository:** [CaffeineToshi/cccs106-projects](https://github.com/CaffeineToshi/cccs106-projects.git)  
- **Local Repository:** âœ… Initialized and connected  
- **Commit History:** 8 commits with clear and descriptive messages  

### Git Skills Demonstrated
- âœ… Repository initialization and configuration  
- âœ… Adding, committing, and pushing changes  
- âœ… Branch creation and merging  
- âœ… Remote repository management

## ðŸ”¹ Flet GUI Applications

### 1. `hello_flet.py`
- **Status:** âœ… Completed  
- **Features:** Interactive greeting, student info display, dialog boxes  
- **UI Components Used:** `Text`, `TextField`, `Button`, `Dialog`, `Container`  
- **Notes:** Initially faced issues with handling button events, but resolved it by properly using the `on_click` callback function.  

### 2. `personal_info_gui.py`
- **Status:** âœ… Completed  
- **Features:** Form inputs, dropdowns, radio buttons, profile generation  
- **UI Components Used:** `TextField`, `Dropdown`, `RadioGroup`, `Container`, `Scrollable` layouts  
- **Error Handling:** Input validation with user-friendly feedback  
- **Notes:** Encountered layout alignment issues, which were solved by using `Row` and `Column` containers with proper spacing.
